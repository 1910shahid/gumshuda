								<h4>About our Initiative</h4>

								<p>Gumshuda portal has been designed and developed adhering
								to the guidelines provided in the Juvenile Justice 
								(Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000 and Model Rules 2007
								and the provisions laid down in the Integrated Child Protection 
								Scheme (ICPS). One of the tasks entrusted under ICPS to the State
								Governments is the setting up of a child tracking system which 
								will facilitate data entry and matching of missing and found 
								children, and also enable follow up of the progress of children 
								who are beneficiaries of the Scheme. Thus, proper monitoring and 
								welfare of the children under the Scheme would also be ensured 
								through the portal.</p>
